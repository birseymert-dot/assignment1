This project is a simple React product dashboard.
The main state is managed in the App component using useState.
The product list visibility is controlled through conditional rendering.
Product data is static and rendered using map in the ProductList component.
Each product is displayed using a reusable Product component wrapped with a Card component that uses children for composition.
No side effects, API calls, or external libraries were used as required.
